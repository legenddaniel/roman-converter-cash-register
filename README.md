# Roman Converter Cash Register
This small demo contains a simple roman converter and a simple cash register based on my online tutorial.

Cash register system is based on greedy algorithm which is more efficient than DP when the face values of cash are regular ones (e.g. 1, 5, 10 as most types of currencies are). Also the quantity of the cash in the cash register is limited which makes it a little bit complicated.
