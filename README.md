# Roman Converter Cash Register
Containing a simple roman converter and a simple cash register from the online tutorials for my self-learning.

Cash register system is based on greedy algorithm which is more efficient than DP when the face values of cash are regular ones (e.g. 1, 5, 10 as most types of currency are). Also the number of cash in the cash register is limited which makes it a little bit complicated.
